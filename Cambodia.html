   	<h1> Cambodia - Siem Reap </h1>
   	<p> If there is a place in Cambodia you should not miss is Siem Reap. This amazing city is located in the Northwestern part of the country and is the capital of the Siem Reap province. It is the most emblematic and visited city of Cambodia due to its remarkable temples, which have the stamp of UNESCO World Heritage site. This complex of temples was built by the Khmer civilization back in the 12th century and was abandoned by the 17th century. The western world only discovered these ancient world wonders in the 19th century and since then several restorations have been put in place.

    <h2> Angkor Wat </h2>
   	<p> 
    Angor Wat (means 'Capital Temple') is the most iconic temple of Siem Reap and the best preserved as well. The temple has become the symbol of Cambodia and if you notice you can see that it appears in the national flag. Known as the largest religious temple in the world, it measures 162 he and it worth a visit at sunrise. The lake in front of the temple reflects its image and you can capture a picture which you will never forget.

   <p>
		Before arriving to the main entrance you have to cross a bridge over the lake which faces the monument. After passing the entrance you find two beautiful Libraries on each side that worth a visit. Before arriving to the central temple there is a huge passage which is guarded along the way by lions and cobras. Notice that the cobras have always odd numbers, most of the time 7 cobras. This was because Khmer people believed odd numbers gave them luck. The temple was built in sandstone and has three central rectangular galleries disposed as a pyramid. The galleries have towers in each corner (some of them partially destroyed) but the inner gallery has still 5 towers: one in each corner and a higher one in the middle, which represents mount Meru. The main galleries are richly decorated with carving that tell us stories about the Khmer Empire and of battles between the Good and Evil.

<h2> Bayon Temple </h2>
  <p>
  	Bayon temple is probably the most enigmatic of all Siem Reap's temples. Built between the 12th and 13th centuries, it has a total of 216 smiling stone faces, some say, representing the Buddha. The temple lies inside Angkor Thom (means Great City), the last city of the Khmer Empire. The city has 9 km2 and is surrounded by 8m high walls and five gates. Inside the site there are other monuments that worth a visit: the Terrace of the Leper King, The terrace of the Elephants, Phimeanakas temple, among others. Do not miss the closest Gate to Bayon temple, which is the most-well preserved. All the main monuments inside Angkor Thom can be visited at a walking distance.

<h2> Ta Prohm Temple </h2>

<p>
	Have you ever watched Lara Croft's Tomb Rider movie? If so, you should definitely visit Ta Prohm temple which was the background of Angelina Jolie's picture. This temple, built in late 12th century and beginning of 13th century, is a quite impressive one as the jungle has taken over it. The sync between architecture and nature is perfect: the roots of the trees grow over the stones as they were an extension of the monument. Trees grow upon the walls and there is vegetation all over the place. It is a pretty unique temple and a memorable one.

  <h2> Tips: </h2>

  <p>
	Visa: If you do not have ASEAN citizenship you should ask for an e-Visa. There are several online websites to apply for a visa but your passport must be valid for +6 months. You can pay the e-visa by credit card but please do not forget to take 2 passport photos for the visa. It will be requested on your arrival at the airport by the visa authorities. 
  </p>

  <p> 
	Currency: In Cambodia you can either use USD or Cambodian Riel currencies. There are plenty ATM machines in Siem Reap in which you can withdraw both currencies.  
  </p>

  <p>
	Best time of the year to visit: The dry season in Cambodia is from November to April. Of course you can visit Siem Reap any other month but then you should check the weather before you travel just because it can be very unpleasant to visit the temples under heavy rain. 
  </p>

  <p>
	Number of days: It is recommendable to spend two or three days visiting the temples (depending on your pace) as it takes some time to move between them. You can either rent a taxi with a driver or a tuk-tuk, being the latter cheaper and a very typical experience. It costs approximately $30 to $40 USD to rent a tuk-tuk with a driver for a weekend (you should always negotiate the prices). If you want to take the most out of your visit you should then ask at your hotel for an official guide to escort you to the temples. It may cost you about $40 USD but it worth the investment.

	Recommended Hotel: FCC Hotel Angkor is a design hotel with a good value for money. It has a small swimming pool and quite affordable SPA in which you can relax after a busy and tiring day at the temples.
